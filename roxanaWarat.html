These synergies occur in the experiential field. It is the deliberate interplay of two forces that inspire and spur each other, in mutual competition. Vibrant wagers where limits fade on behalf of the creative process, with a single, tangible result: objects, lived situations, graphic evidences, or pieces of work whose making can be read as either art or fashion, indifferently.<br />
      Roxana Warat established contact with art in the '90s. Attracted by it, she became a collector of contemporary art while she made studies related to the subject she was keen on. One of her interests â€“or focuses- has to do with the relationship between different supports and the resulting visual expressions. As she moves away from the role of the spectator to become a creator, she takes the very body to submit it to intervention practices. To that effect, she makes jewelry pieces, which, away from design concerns -ergonomics, for example-, are aimed at introducing excess in form and, through it, guide gesture and establish a communicational code.<br />
      Those were the steps she followed and, as she was free from what we might call &quot;the laws of the market&quot;, they have taken her along a path running on the edge of things, such a diffuse and premeditated edge that we can speak of art. Concept, process and ritual. Three elements aimed at endowing jewelry with a deep meaning.</p>
      <p style="color:
    #FFF; font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif">Warat's objects intervene on hands and make gesture conscious within the framework of a specific space-time situation. They make the observer's eyes shift. They hamper daily acts. They emerge with a playful-erotic load and have the virtual weight of talismans. They were not created to be useful; they are aimed at giving satisfaction.</p>
