						Along culture's history, there are instances where art and fashion
						converge to create transcendental experiences. These synergies
						occur in the experiential field. It is the deliberate interplay of
						two forces that inspire and spur each other, in mutual
						competition. Vibrant wagers where limits fade on behalf of the
						creative process, with a single, tangible result: objects, lived
						situations, graphic evidences, or pieces of work whose making can
						be read as either art or fashion, indifferently.<br /> Roxana
						Warat established contact with art in the '90s. Attracted by it,
						she became a collector of contemporary art while she made studies
						related to the subject she was keen on. One of her interests –or
						focuses- has to do with the relationship between different
						supports and the resulting visual expressions. As she moves away
						from the role of the spectator to become a creator, she takes the
						very body to submit it to intervention practices. To that effect,
						she makes jewelry pieces, which, away from design concerns
						-ergonomics, for example-, are aimed at introducing excess in form
						and, through it, guide gesture and establish a communicational
						code.<br /> Those were the steps she followed and, as she was
						free from what we might call &quot;the laws of the market&quot;,
						they have taken her along a path running on the edge of things,
						such a diffuse and premeditated edge that we can speak of art.
						Concept, process and ritual. Three elements aimed at endowing
						jewelry with a deep meaning.
					</p>
					<p>Warat's
						objects intervene on hands and make gesture conscious within the
						framework of a specific space-time situation. They make the
						observer's eyes shift. They hamper daily acts. They emerge with a
						playful-erotic load and have the virtual weight of talismans. They
						were not created to be useful; they are aimed at giving
						satisfaction.</p>
